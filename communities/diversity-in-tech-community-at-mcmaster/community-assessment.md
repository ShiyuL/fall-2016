## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics broadly during week 1, and discuss responses in more detail in week 2. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

After you've completed these questions, define your community in several short paragraphs for discussion in week 2.

### Definition
- How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:
  - Students interested in tech from all fields of study at and around McMaster

### Size
- How many people are currently in your community? 
  - We have around 1500 members in the community which are mostly undergraduate students in Engineering that we are capable of reaching out to but only around 100-200 of these students actively attend tech related activities on campus.
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?
  - Ideally, I would like to see more active members among the 1500 students who are following the tech community here at McMaster.      Additionally, I would like to expand our community scope to alumni students, graduate students, students outside the engineering stream, and perhaps high school students who are interested in exploring and working with technology. If I am to put a number on the students I would like to have in our tech community, I would say 3000 people.
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?
  - McMaster has a very small cs program (~50-60 students in each year) and a regular sized engineering program which has roughly 800 students enrolled each year. A few years ago the tech community consisted of very disbursed and isolated group as there were no particular group that tried to reach out to the whole community. We had programming clubs and a computer science society that may have unintentionallly discouraged students who did not feel fit in these specific groups or were intimidated by the title of these groups. There were also a lack of general tech events on campus. Fortunately, a few McMaster student noticed the gap between the number of students interested in tech and the approchability of the tech community. HackItMac started as a student group to bring accessible tech events to campus such as workshops and code nights with the purpose of bringing the student tech community together. DeltaHacks was the biggest and most successiful initiative of the group. DeltaHacks has since then became the annual hackathon for change at mcmaster. For the past three years there have been significant increase in the number and diversity of the student attendees at these events and we realized the potential of empowering students in technology. Now HackItMac has rebranded into PhaseOne. DeltaHacks is still a division under PhaseOne but PhaseOne also focuses on empowering students through other ways such as supporting student initives, getting involved with the addition of a makerspace on campus and holding a larger variety of tech workshops.

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
  - Currently there are workshops held from time to time mainly by students, Code Night where people are welcomed to drop by and to work on any of their side projects with friends, and talks held by companies but most events are one-time and as a result attendence does not seem to be too high.
- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?
  - Code Nights is a weekly event held on campus which creates a relaxing environment for people to work on any side projects or assignments they have and interact with their peers, programming competitions are held a few times each year, professors and TAs hold office offers solely for the courses offered, and seminars are occasionally held by students or companies with the purpose of searching for student talent. I am one of the organizers of DeltaHacks, the hackathon for change at mcmaster which typically consist of 400 student attendees with a good turn out of projects.

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
  - I would say it is relatively hard to get access to the current resources in the community. Although the community has became a lot more active in the past few years, events are generally inconsistent which means retaining the same interest and attendence is difficult. We also have some trouble reaching out to all the students we want because we mainly rely on social network for marketing events. The people we reach out to are mainly in technical streams so we find it difficult to reach out to the broader community which may be interest in these resources. People may also be hesitant to reach out to these resources when they do not have enough information regarding the quality of the resources to decide whether their want to invest their times. There may need to be ways of enforcing legitimacy of the events as well as offering incentives just to get more people coming out to the events and interested in technology. I believe the initial commitment is fairly important to spark the initial interest people have and to dissolve any uncertainties they worry about.
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
  - Generally, meetings are held during the night time on weekdays to avoid conflicts with people's schedules. Even so, some people have night classes, other commitments or they commute to campus which makes it hard to find a right time for everyone.
- Is there childcare available?
  - Not as far as I am aware.
- Is there accessibility for people with disabilities?
  - Yes, we try our best to be aware of the need for accomodation and provide accomandations for those in need. Most of the accibilities issues are already solved through the facilities on campus which offers accessibility for people with disabilities but we try to find out about any accomodations ahead of any events when collecting general information from the attendees of the event.

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
 Â - We have a very small computer science program, most of our community is actually made up of the engineering and the computer science students. I am glad to see the high involvement from students in these two streams but I think technology is a relevant part of everyone's lives in the current age and there are possibly a large number of students interested in learning about technology out there. Many of them may either be unaware or do not have a way of finding access to the right resources they need because they do not have the same background as the more technical students. This is also an aim of DeltaHacks, we want to increase diveristy in terms of the male to female ratio, experienced vs beginner ratio and a more diverse involvement of students from different programs of study.
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
  - There are a few main streams of technology that people are generally interested in, including machine learning, VR/AR technology, arduinos, and web development. If possible I would like to bring more varieties of interesting topics to the community.

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community? 
  - The main reason people get involved in my community are to expand their interests and knowledge, gain professional development experiences, and to meet other people who share the same interest in technology.
- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
  - Certainly, this is one of the reasons students devote a large amount of their time towards academic requrements. They have to balance their free time wisely to decide how they want to get involve in the community and in what ways.
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?
  - I think this is a main reason for most students who get involve in the community as well, they want to expand their knowledge and skills outside the classroom and to get hands on experience with technology that is trending so that they are more prepared for job search.
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
  - Most students interested in developing are still computer science and engineering students, but I have seen a considerable number of students in other streams who are very passionate about developing. It is also interesting students in other streams combine technology with their major to create very applicable applications that solves real problems.
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?
  - I am thinking a lot about setting activities and goals which would both benefit the students in their self and professional development while they could have a good time. One idea I have is to set up a series of consistent workshops which has a good coverage of topics on all the trending technology and how students can use what they learn to build their own projects. The workshops could range from beginner friendly to advance for students with different backgrounds. It would also be very interesting to invite speakers on campus to share their experiences and knowldge which may paint for the students a more accurate picture about their career interests or just to learn about the technology out there in general.

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
  - My community currently gather on campus where class rooms may be booked in advance. The locations are not consistent and can only booked temporately for specific events.
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
  - We have an online group, physical meet ups are only schedule for specific workshops and events as well as for the Code Nights every week and the attendence to the physical events are not as high as I would like to see.
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
  - There is parking on campus but a flat rate is charged for all parking spots. Rates are a little lower on the weekends. For very large events like DeltaHacks, we cover the cost of parking by buying bulk parking permits from the parking office which are fairly cheap.
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
  - We have a public transportation system in the city that is convenient to take to get to campus for the meet-ups. Espcially for the students the bus passes are covered in the tution therefore public transportation is free.
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
  - The locations are opened to our whole community but generally only students attend the events. Most students above second year are living off-campus but are in a fairly close distance where public transportations are convenient. 
- How much does it cost to use the space?
  - The space we rent on campus are free. The reason we avoid venues off campus is due to the high cost of renting the venue and sometimes the inconveniences of reaching there.
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
  - The spaces are generally well equipment with all the technology we need for the meetings and presentations. We can book different classrooms on campus and request for different technology that we need such as projector and audio and visual equipments as long as we book the spaces early enough. Most classrooms have projectors set up and generally students bring their own computers.
- How many people can it fit?
  - The capacity of the space varies greatly depending on the expected attendees we anticipate for the events.For Code Nights, we generally accept 20 attendees and a regular classroom would safice. For the hackthon, we book multiple rooms in multiple buildings to make sure we can fit the 400 attendees we anticipate. The larger the number of attendees, the ealier we need to figure out the logistic issues. Up to now we have not grown to the size where we encountered a problem in which we ran out of space for attendees.
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
  - Seatings are generally comfortable and for all sizes. We book different spaces depending on the nature of the events.
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?
  - Other than DeltaHacks in which we provide free food and drinks for the attendees for the whole weekend, most events do not provide food or drinks. We are trying to bring pizza to Code Nights but our budget is a little tights. For all other events, there are vendors selling food in almost all the buildings on campus and a large number of water fountains available in each building.

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
  - The most common way of communication in my community is through online social media, more specifically facebook. We have a facebook group used to promote events from the club and a page for students to post about events they are intersted in. There are many other facebook groups for different subgroups inside the community. I think there are also a few slack groups that are used for communication but I am not in many of these groups myself. Additionally, students and people in the community have their own private groups in which they exchange information and they also communicate through their programs of study.
- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?
  - We have a mail list from McMaster which emails all the engineering students about the tech resources and events on campus and sometimes helps promote student run events. I would say facebook is still the main way of reaching out to the community although other social media accounts such as twitter and blogs are also synchronized. There may also be a few slack channels for chatting but I am only in a few internal slack grousp.
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?
  - I think my organization would benefit from a good a mix of all the forms of communications. People in the community check their social media accounts the most often thus those are the best ways for us to market and raise awareness about our events. Additionally, having an email sent out for us through our faculty mail list or our own mail lists indicates the legidimacy and organization behind our events which I think will increase the attendence at our events.

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
  - My community are very welcoming to new people and new ideas. We always say we are just a group of students with ideas and in order to do more for the community we want to hear ideas from those in the community as well.I think the main issue is with the communication gap where students with good ideas may not necessarily be aware of the support from the community or somehow may not be able to share their ideas with the community.
- What happens if there is a disagreement? How will you personally handle it?
  - We definitely try to encourage different opinions in the community. I myself espcially think disgreement is away of prevent group think and spark new ideas. I think it is important to set procedures in place to settle disagreements that may be harmful or escalate to an unhealthy situation but a certain degree of disagreement is good for discussion. As long as communication is timely and everyone approach the disagreement with an open mind the disagreement should resolve itself. If necessary, someone neutrual could be present to facilt
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
  - For DeltaHacks, we have the MLH Code of Conduct which everyone follows which stands for inclusivity. Everyone should be respectful to each other. Harassements and abuse are never tolerated. We have a procedure to follow when reporting situations which involves violation of the code and consequences for those who violate the code to make sure we create an open and approachable environment for everyone in the community. Internally in the organization, we follow the same conduct/policy but we currently don't have anything written down for the students. Inside the executive team, we do have a club policy and team expectation documents in which the whole team is aware of and we would refer to those documents when encountering disagreements.
